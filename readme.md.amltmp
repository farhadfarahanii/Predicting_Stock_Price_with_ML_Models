# Predicting Stock Price with ML Models

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of historical Apple stock prices over the years, utilizing time series techniques. The project aims to explore trends, patterns, and seasonality in the stock data, and to implement various machine learning time series models, including LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), to predict future stock prices. By comparing and evaluating the performance of different models, the project seeks to identify the most effective approach for forecasting Apple's stock prices, providing valuable insights for investors and financial analysts.

## Background
Apple Inc., one of the world's leading technology companies, has been a prominent player in the global stock market, attracting investors seeking potential profits from its shares. Understanding the historical trends and patterns in Apple's stock prices is crucial for investors to make informed decisions. Moreover, predicting future stock prices accurately is a challenging yet essential task for financial analysts and traders. Time series analysis provides valuable tools to explore historical data, detect underlying patterns, and forecast future prices. The project aims to leverage these techniques, including ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models, which capture trends and seasonality in the data. Additionally, advanced forecasting methods like Prophet, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and other innovative models will be explored, to gain insights into Apple's stock behavior and enhance prediction accuracy, ultimately aiding investors and financial analysts in making well-informed decisions in the dynamic stock market landscape.
